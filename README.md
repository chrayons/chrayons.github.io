# Christina's NYC Bucket List

This is a personal bucket list where I can keep track of all the places I want to visit in New York City before my time here is up! I hope that by exploring this project, you also discover some fun places to experience.

## Process

I began by designing a mockup in Figma, collecting all my must-visit places in Apple Notes, and then building the website using HTML and CSS.

Throughout the development process, I asked questions to my partner and friends, and referenced online videos and tutorials. Thank you to the coding community for making learning more accessible and fun!! I still have a lot more to learn.

## Next Steps

- Add JavaScript to filter entries by status (e.g., “to-try” vs. “favorites”)
- Add a location data attribute to explore spots by neighborhood/area
- Continue improving design and accessibility as I learn more 😁
