# Christina's NYC Bucket List

This is a personal bucket list where I can keep track of all the places I want to visit in New York City before my time here is up! I hope that by exploring this project, you also discover some fun places to experience.

## Context

I’ve been meaning to create a bucket list of all
the places I want to visit, because I’m the
type of person who will save things and then never look at them again,
since I know the archive will always be there. (But don't be fooled! These archives are not permanent
and you should probably save backups. Anywho...)

This project started off as a student assignment where we had to create a website using only HTML and CSS.
Specifically, the requirements were:

HTML:
- Must include a page named index.html (as your site’s homepage)
- Should include additional HTML files as necessary to build out your site (for a total of 3 to 5 html files i.e. web pages), e.g. resume.html, all relatively linked through some form of navigational section throughout your site.
- All your html file(s) must be implemented using HTML5 and should be validated in an html5 validator (e.g. https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input )
- Within your’s HTML site, include at a minimum:
    - One table (with any contents)
    - One ordered list (with any contents)
    - One unordered list (with any contents)
    - A third list that is a nested list (with any contents)
    - Links and images*, as appropriate
    - Copyright symbol, your name, and the current year at the end of every page
    - *Images must adhere to copyright law. Use your own multi-media work or freely reusable images (e.g. Creative Commons licensed work, DALL-E images you create, etc.)

CSS:
- Your HTML files should link to your external css file in the head of your file (e.g., <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="screen.css">) and all CSS styles should be contained in this one external CSS file that is used across every page in your site.
- Your CSS file must validate according to the http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ validator.
- In your CSS styles, you should at a minimum:
    - Define and use several type selector, e.g. p {…}
    - Define and use several id selector, e.g. #footer {…}
    - Define and use several class selector, e.g. .description {…}
    - Use CSS to generally style your page(s), e.g. to control border, width, color, background-color, font style, font size, layout and positioning, etc.

## Process

It was important to me to make this accessible and scalable for my own purposes. I wanted to share this with friends,
so it had to be mobile-friendly. And I wanted to be able to add more entries and potentially sort them in the future with filters/tags, so I explored what
kinds of database-like patterns or workarounds I could use without a backend.

I began by designing a mockup in Figma, collecting all my must-visit places in Apple Notes, and then building the website using HTML and CSS.
Throughout the development process, I asked questions to my partner and friends,
and referenced online videos and tutorials. Any explicitly referenced snippets are credited in-source as comments.
More specific solutions were workshopped by me (alone or with peers for advice).
Thank you to the coding community for making learning more accessible and fun!!
I still have so much more to learn.

To me, this felt like a playground of exploration. I definitely didn’t solve every logic
challenge on my own, but finding the right lines of code, tutorials,
and advice to bring my Figma idea to life was really fulfilling.

## Next Steps

- Add JavaScript to filter entries by status (e.g., “to-try” vs. “loved”)
- Add a location data attribute to explore spots by neighborhood/area
- Continue improving design and accessibility as I learn more 😁
